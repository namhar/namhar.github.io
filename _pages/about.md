Scientist by day, part-type faculty by night, perpetual learner always. 

I'm passionate about teaching computers to perceive and interact with our world. Currently an Applied Scientist @Xbox focused on deep learning & computer vision. Previous experience across surgical robotics & healthcare. Primary interests are Machine Learning, Computational Perception and Bio-inspired Computing with ever growing interests in evolutionary biology and complex systems. On the side I'm an Instructional Associate @GaTech (Georgia Institute of Technology) for CS7643 (Deep Learning).
