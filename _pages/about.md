I'm passionate about teaching computers to perceive and interact with our world. Currently an Applied Scientist @Xbox focused on deep learning & computer vision. Also an instructional associate @ Georgia Institute of Technology. Previous experience across surgical robotics & healthcare. Broadly interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning with ever growing interest in complex systems. Specifically weak/un/self-supervised methods, video recognition/understanding and 3D reconstruction from video.
